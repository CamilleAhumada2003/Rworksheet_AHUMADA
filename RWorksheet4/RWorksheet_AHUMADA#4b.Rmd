```

#1. Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in Figure 1. It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero matrix.

vector_A <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

matrix_A <- matrix(0,nrow = 5, ncol =5)

for (j in 1:5)
  for (k in 1:5)
  {
    matrix_A[j,k] <- abs (vector_A[j] - vector_A[k])
  }

matrix_A

#2. Print the string "*" using for() function. The output should be the same as shown in Figure1

for (j in 1:5) {
  cat(paste0("\"", rep("*", j), "\""), "\n")
}

#3. Get an input from the user to print the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 1st input up to 500. Use repeat and break statements. Write the R Scripts and its output.
