## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#1. The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.

dtaframe <- data.frame (Gender=c("F","F","F","F","M","F","F","F","M","F","M","F","M","M","M","M","F","F","M","F","F","M","M","F","M","M","M","M"),
                 Shoe_Size=c(6.5,9.0,8.5,8.5,10.5,7.0,9.5,9.0,13.0,7.5,10.5,8.5,12.0,10.5,13.0,11.5,8.5,5.0,10.0,6.5,7.5,8.5,10.5,8.5,10.5,11.0,9.0,13.0),
                 Height=c(66.0,68.0,64.5,65.0,70.0,64.0,70.0,71.0,72.0,64.0,74.5,67.0,71.0,71.0,77.0,72.0,59.0,62.0,72.0,66.0,64.0,67.0,73.0,69.0,72.0,70.0,69.0,70.0))

dtaframe

#a. Describe the data.

#The gender, shoe size, and height of each person are all listed in this data set.

#Along with the associated values for each attribute. With only 28 data points, the dataset seems to be somewhat little.

#b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height.

femalessubset <- dtaframe[dtaframe$Gender == "F", c("Gender", "Shoe_Size", "Height")]
femalessubset

malessubset <- dtaframe[dtaframe$Gender == "M", c("Gender", "Shoe_Size", "Height")]
malessubset


#c.Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.

meanshoesize <- mean(df$Shoe_Size)
meanheight <- mean(df$Height)

meanshoesize
meanheight

#d.Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?

# The two are inversely correlated, with the shoe size directly relating to height. Smaller shoe sizes are correlated with smaller heights.

#2.Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.

months_vector <- c("March","April","January","November","January","September","October","September","November","August","January","November","November","February","May","August","July","December","August","August","September","November","February","April")
months_vector
factor_months_vector <- factor(months_vector)
factor_months_vector

#3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. | Interpret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?

summary(months_vector)
summary(factor_months_vector)

# The number of observations, class, and mode of the months_vector are displayed in the summary. 

# The frequency of each month is shown in the factor_months_vector summary.

#Both are helpful in various situations where the quantity of observations, class, mode, or frequency are required.

#4.Create a vector and factor for the table

factor_data <- c(1,4,3)
new_order_data <- factor(factor_data,levels = c("East","West","North"))
print(new_order_data)

#5.Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv



#6.Full Search
randomNum <- readline(prompt = "Enter number from 1 to 50: ")
randomNum <- as.numeric(randomNum)
paste("The number you have chosen is", randomNum)
if (randomNum > 50) {
  paste("The number selected is beyond the range of 1 to 50")
} else if (randomNum == 20) {
  paste("TRUE")
} else {
  paste(randomNum)
}

#7.Change

minimum_Bills <- function(price) {
  
  minBills <- price %/% 50
  paste("The minimum no. of bills:", minBills)
}
minimum_Bills(90)


#8. The following is each studentâ€™s math score for one semester. Based on this, answer the following questions.



#a. Create a dataframe from the above table. Write the R codes and its output.

names <- c("Annie", "Thea", "Steve", "Hanna")
grade1 <- c(85,65,75,95)
grade2 <- c(65,75,55,75)
grade3 <- c(85,90,80,100)
grade4 <- c(100,90,85,90)
math <- data.frame(
  Name = names,
  Grade1 = grade1,
  Grade2 = grade2,
  Grade3 = grade3,
  Grade4 = grade4
)
math

#b.
