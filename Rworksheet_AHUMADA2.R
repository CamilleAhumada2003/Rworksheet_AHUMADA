#Worksheet #2

#1 Create a vector using: operator

#a. Sequence from -5 to 5. Write the R code and its output.
#Describe its output.
Negative5to5<-seq(-5,5)
Negative5to5

#b. x <- 1:7. What will be the value of x?
x<-

#2Create a vector using seq() function

#a. seq(1, 3, by=0.2) # specify step size
#Write the R script and its output. Describe the output.

#3. A factory has a census of its workers. There are 50 workers in total. The following
#list shows their ages:

#a. Access 3rd element, what is the value?
  
#b. Access 2nd and 4th element, what are the values?
  
#c. Access all but the 4th and 12th element is not
#included. Write the R script and its output.

#4. *Create a vector x <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9). Then named the
vector, names(x).

#a. Print the results. Then access x[c("first", "third")].
Describe the output.
